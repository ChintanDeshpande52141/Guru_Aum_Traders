          <p>
            In 1970, we started with a mission to bring pure, farm-fresh
            products to every household. Coming from a family of farmers, we
            knew the value of honest produce and the stories behind every grain.
          </p>
          <p>
            What began in a small village warehouse is now a trusted source of
            naturally grown grains, jaggery, and more — delivered straight to
            your door. Along the way, we’ve built strong relationships with
            farmers and customers alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal has always been simple: support local, promote purity, and
            serve with integrity. Today, our journey continues, powered by your
            trust and the hard work of countless hands behind the scenes.
